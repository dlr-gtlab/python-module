## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
 - Fixed an error, when a subprocess tries to redirect messages to the GTlab console.
   The missing fileno() method of has been implemented.
   Note: the redirection using a file handle is not properly supported!
   Instead, the messages will be printed to a system terminal - #277
 - The Python Task and Calculator wizard no longer increases in height each time it is reopened. - #607

### Added
 - Log messages in Python by passing an argument to the logging functions (e.g. gtDebug('debug message'), gtInfo('info message'), etc.). Logging via the lshift operator is still supported but is no longer recommended (e.g., gtDebug() << 'debug message'). - #595
 - Added envVars() function to access GTlab environment variables from Python code. - #604
 - Python messages are now prefixed with the task / calculator, where they are created.
   This results in a much better usability when debugging the source of potential errors. - #606, #614
 - input_args for Python Tasks and Calculators supports boolean values. - #265
 - The scripts/python subdirectory of the current GTlab project is now automatically added to Pythonâ€™s sys.path.
   Python modules placed in this directory can be imported via the embedded Python interpreter in GTlab.
   When the current project changes, the previous path is removed from sys.path and the new one is added. - #618
 - Added env_vars() function to access GTlab environment variables from Python code. - #604
 - The Python function `GTlab.openProject` can now be used also with the project path argument.
   This automatically imports a project into the current session, if it is not yet imported.
   Example: `GTlab.openProject('/home/user/myproject/project.gtlab')` - #565

## [1.7.1] - 2025-04-23

### Added

   python version. - #587
 - Support for an embedded python distribution, that comes along with GTlab - #585
